- As a user, I would like to be able to read discriptions and outlooks of specific paintings *Stretch*
- As a user, I would like to save paintings that I like or hope to purchase in my own personal cart or saved list *Stretch*
- As a user, I would like to possibly look for specific paintings by name, possibly even type or catagory. *Stretch*
- As a user, I would like to be able to submit my own paintings for review and possible sale *Super Stretch*
